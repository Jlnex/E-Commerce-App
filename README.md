# 📖 About the Project
This application was developed to simulate the basic user experience of an e-commerce website (listing products, adding them to the cart, and updating the cart). The main focus of the project is to demonstrate data management (Local Storage) and dynamic interface (DOM) manipulation capabilities with JavaScript.

Product data is retrieved from the db.json file rather than an external database.

# ✨ Application Features
Product Listing: Dynamically displaying products retrieved from the db.json file on the homepage (index.html).

Cart Management: Adding products to the cart, removing them, and updating their quantities.

Local Storage: Stores the cart contents in the browser's memory, ensuring data is not lost when the page is refreshed.

Cart Summary: Calculates the total number of products in the cart and the total cart price.

Advanced Styling: Using the SCSS preprocessor for a streamlined and modular CSS structure.

Responsive Design: Providing a seamless shopping experience on all devices.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Page structure and semantic markup.

SCSS (Sass): Modular and maintainable style sheets.

Vanilla JavaScript: Cart logic, data retrieval, and DOM interaction management.

db.json: For holding mock product data.
